*Last Updated: December 2025*

## Overview

Ashtonne's Blackjack is a free, open-source blackjack game. This privacy policy explains our commitment to your privacy and clarifies what data, if any, may be collected when you use the application.

## Data Collection by the Application

**The application source code contains no telemetry, analytics, or data collection.**

Specifically, the application does NOT:

- Collect personal information
- Track your gameplay or behavior
- Access your contacts, location, or files
- Use advertising SDKs or analytics frameworks
- Transmit any data to our servers (we have no servers)
- Require an internet connection to function

All game data (settings, bankroll) is stored locally on your device using the platform's standard preferences system. This application does not transmit this data anywhere.

## Data Collection by Distribution Platforms

When you download this application from the Google Play Store or other distribution platforms, those platforms may independently collect certain information according to their own privacy policies. This may include:

- Download and installation statistics
- Device information for compatibility purposes
- Crash reports (if you have opted in to share diagnostics with Google)
- Basic app usage statistics

**We have no access to or control over data collected by distribution platforms.** For information about what Google collects, please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

The application requests **no special permissions** on Android. It operates as a standalone game with no network access, no file system access beyond app-local storage, and no access to device sensors or personal data.

## Children's Privacy
